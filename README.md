--------------------------
####An Introduction to Javascript

_Just when you thought it was safe to go back to the internet..._

####Objective
Having implemented [Rock-paper-scissors-Sinatra-Dino] as a challenge the week
before we were gently introduced to [JavaScript] using th same project. We were
tasked with implementing the game again but this time as a one page app with all
the logic in JS.

We were also directed to use some [jQuery] for presentation, which can be seen in
the results list, as well as testing using [Jasmine]

It features some horrific CSS effects on some very simple images thanks to the
over-indulgent powers of the `-webkit-filters` operator. I apologise if you need
new glasses :eyes: :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

####Technologies used

+ Production
  + [CSS3]
  + [HTML5]
  + [JavaScript]
  + [jQuery]

+ Testing
  + [Jasmine]

####Installation

Clone the repo with the following command (you will need to install [Git]):
```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:gypsydave5/git.git
```

Change into the project directory
```shell
$ cd rps-javascript
```

And open `index.html` with your choice of browser.

####Testing

The [Jasmine] tests may be run by opening the `SpecRunner.html` file in your
choice of browser.
