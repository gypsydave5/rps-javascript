Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock Javascript
===========================================

_Just when you thought it was safe to go back to the internet..._

This is a one-page app using Javascript and jQuery, allowing you to play the
classic game of Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock against a completely random
computer opponent.

It features some horrific CSS effects on some very simple images thanks to the
over-indulgent powers of the `-webkit-filters` operator. I apologise if you need
new glasses.
